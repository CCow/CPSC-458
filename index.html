                    My name is Connor Cowher, I am 22 years old and currently living in Orange California. I graduated from 
                    Warwick High School in June of 2018 with a 3.7 G.P.A. Life was busy for me inside and outside of school.
                    I was involved in National Honor society, Student Council Treasurer, Chess Club, Interact, Unite, 
                    School Soccer team, and quizbowl substitute.

                    Outside of school I spent most of my time getting school work done as soon as possible. I also worked a 
                    job at my local movie theater for over two years. I was also part of a couple various travel soccer 
                    programs around my area, PA Classics, Lititz youth soccer club, and Penn Legacy.

                    I am currently a senior computer science major at Chapman University, set to graduate in the fall of 2022.
                    I have a considerable depth of knowledge in a wide range of programming languages. These include Java, Python,
                    C/C#/C++, Haskell, Linux, Swift, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SQL/SQLite, and R.

                    For fun I like to work on the hardware on the PC I built in the spring of 2019. I am mildly interested in
                    E-Sports and casual gaming. I love to travel whenever I can get the chance. In recent memory I drove from my hometown
                    of Lititz, Pennsylvania all the way to Orange, California. The trip consisted of me, my brother, and my dad and we 
                    stopped at some major landmarks here in the U.S. Some of my favorites include Antelope Canyon AZ, Jackson Hole WY, and Mount Rushmore SD.
